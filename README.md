# The Travelling Salesperson Problem's intractability and approximations
This project aims to take a look at the real-world challenges of implementing solutions for a `hard problem` such as the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP). This will be done by implementing an optimal (but expensive) solution and comparing it to two approximation algorithms.

## Implementation Objectives
- A slightly-better-then-brute-force solution using a branch-and-bound algorithm
- A Twice-around-the-tree approximation algorithm
- A Christofides approximation algorithm
- A comparison of the performance (time and space) and accuracy of the algorithms
